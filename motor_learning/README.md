# Motor Learning Experiments

The output of the simulink file demonstrates how different curves can be used for converting force into positions on the screen.
With this, it is possible to design experiments for studying motor learning.
Top: Force in V
Middle: Linear conversion from V to pixels
Botoom: 0-2V: Linear conversion, 2V-5V: exponential curve
